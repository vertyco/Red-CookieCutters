# Cog Templates for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)

This repository contains templates that I use for my own cogs. Feel free to use them as you wish ðŸ™‚

_These templates are designed to support Python 3.10 and above._

- [cookiecutter-simple](cookiecutter-simple/README.md): Simple as it gets, just barebones requirements.
- [cookiecutter-pydantic](cookiecutter-pydantic/README.md): Fully structured cog schema that uses Pydantic for easier config management.
- [cookiecutter-postgres](cookiecutter-postgres/README.md): Similar to the pydantic version but with full postgres support.
